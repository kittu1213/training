        //a promise a special javascript object that represents the eventual completion(or failure ) 
        //of an asynchronous operation .
        //it allows to handle asynchronous tasks more efficiently than callbacks .
        //three states:
        //1)pending : the initial state,the promise is still waiting for the operation to finish
        //2)fulfilled : the operation completed successfully.
        //3)Rejected: the operation failed.

        //exp:
        //1)to create a promise -new promise()
        //Two parameters-
        //resolve -- to mark the promise as successfully 
        //reject --mark it as failed

        //2)handling the result:
        //then()method is called when promise is fullfilled.
        //It will receives the result from resolve()
        //catch() method is called if the promise is rejected it receives the error message from reject().
        
        //example:
        let mypromise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
            let success =true;
            if(success){
                resolve("the operation is successfull");
            }else{
                reject("the operation failed")
            }
        });
        mypromise
        .then(result=>{
            console.log(result);
        });
        mypromise
        .catch(error=>{
            console.log(error);
        })
